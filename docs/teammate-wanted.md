# Looking for a Hackathon Teammate - Perplexity Sonar API Project

## Project: TrendPulse Dashboard

I'm developing TrendPulse - a real-time dashboard that leverages Perplexity's Sonar API to track evolving topics with AI-generated summaries. The core functionality is already working, and I've made significant progress on the frontend with AI assistance. With over 2 weeks left in the hackathon, I'm looking for a technical teammate to help refine and enhance what's already built.

## About Me:
- AI enthusiast with tech support background
- Self-taught coding enthusiast learning as I go
- Using AI tools (including Claude) to help with development
- Passionate about creating useful applications with AI technologies
- Strong understanding of user needs and requirements

## Project Status:
- Frontend is functional with responsive mobile and desktop views
- Core API integration with Perplexity Sonar is working
- Basic database structure implemented
- Main features operational (topic streams, updates, feed view)
- Still could use polish, optimization, and feature enhancements

## Skills That Would Be Helpful:

### Development Expertise
- **Code review & optimization** - Help improve existing React and backend code
- **API refinement** - Enhance the current integration with Perplexity's Sonar API
- **Performance tuning** - Identify and fix any bottlenecks in the application

### Nice-to-Have Technical Skills
- **Testing implementation** - Adding proper test coverage
- **Code architecture improvements** - Suggestions for better organization
- **UX enhancements** - Ideas for improving user experience
- **Git workflow** - Help with managing the codebase effectively

### AI/LLM Knowledge
- **Prompt engineering insights** - Refining existing prompts for better results
- **Creative ideas** for leveraging AI capabilities in the application

## What I Bring to the Table:
- Project vision and product direction
- UI/UX design sensibilities
- Technical support background and troubleshooting skills
- Willingness to learn and adapt quickly
- Experience using AI tools for development assistance
- Strong communication and collaboration skills

## Time Commitment:
- Hackathon runs until May 28, 2025 (12:00 pm PT) - just over 2 weeks remaining
- Flexible time commitment - even a few hours of expertise would be valuable
- Asynchronous collaboration is fine - no strict schedule required

## Why Join?
- Jump into a project that's already functional - no starting from scratch
- Contribute meaningful improvements to an almost-complete application
- Work with cutting-edge AI APIs in a collaborative environment
- Opportunity to mentor someone passionate about AI development
- Great portfolio addition demonstrating AI integration skills

If you're interested, reach out to me at [your contact info] with a brief overview of your experience. I'm looking for someone who enjoys collaborating and can provide some technical guidance to help take this project across the finish line.
