## Planned Automated Tests

The following tests should be implemented as unit or integration tests:

1. Form validation tests
2. API call retry logic
3. Error handling for all operations
4. Stream deletion workflow

## Notes

- Mock API responses should be used for automated tests
- API error simulation can be done using a proxy like MSW
- Visual regression tests are recommended for UI components
